# Generated Workflows

This directory contains automatically generated `.tsx` files from the Workflow Builder.

## What's in here?

Each exported workflow creates a `.tsx` file containing:

- **Workflow Configuration**: Complete JSON representation of nodes and edges
- **Metadata**: Agent name, description, version, timestamp
- **Helper Functions**: Utilities for debugging and inspecting the workflow
- **Summary Statistics**: Node counts, types, and connection info

## File Structure

Generated files follow this naming pattern:
```
[AgentName]_[AgentId].tsx
```

## Purpose

These files are intended for:
- **Debugging**: Inspect workflow configurations and data flow
- **Auditing**: Track workflow changes and versions over time
- **Code Generation**: Potential future use for generating React components
- **Documentation**: Human-readable workflow definitions

## Usage

Each generated file exports:
- `workflowConfig`: Complete workflow data
- `WorkflowMetadata`: Basic information
- `WorkflowNodes` / `WorkflowEdges`: Direct access to workflow elements
- `WorkflowSummary`: Statistics and analysis
- Helper functions for debugging

## Generated by
