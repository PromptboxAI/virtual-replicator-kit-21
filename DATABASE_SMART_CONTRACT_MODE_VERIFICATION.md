# Database vs Smart Contract Mode - Implementation Verification

## Problem Statement
System was in "database" mode but user switched to "smart_contract" mode. Need to verify that:
1. Database trading is blocked for smart contract agents
2. Agent creation respects the deployment mode setting
3. Trades are routed correctly (database vs DEX)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Admin Settings Query** ✅
- **File**: Direct database query
- **Change**: Verified `deployment_mode` is set to `'smart_contract'` in `admin_settings` table
- **Verification**: Run this query to confirm:
  ```sql
  SELECT key, value FROM admin_settings WHERE key = 'deployment_mode';
  ```
  Should return: `{"value": "smart_contract"}`

---

### 2. **Agent Creation Flow** ✅
- **File**: `src/pages/CreateAgent.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Reads `adminSettings?.deployment_mode` 
  - Sets agent `status` to `'DEPLOYING_CONTRACT'` if in smart_contract mode
  - Sets `token_graduated: true` for smart contract agents (blocks database trading)
  - Stores `creation_mode: adminSettings?.deployment_mode` in agents table

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Go to `/create-agent`
  2. Create a new agent
  3. Check database:
     ```sql
     SELECT id, name, creation_mode, status, token_graduated, deployment_mode 
     FROM agents 
     ORDER BY created_at DESC 
     LIMIT 1;
     ```
  4. Should show:
     - `creation_mode: 'smart_contract'`
     - `status: 'DEPLOYING_CONTRACT'`
     - `token_graduated: true`

---

### 3. **Trading Protection Guard** ✅
- **File**: `src/components/SmartContractModeGuard.tsx` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: UI component that blocks database trading for smart contract agents
- **Props**:
  - `agentCreationMode`: 'database' | 'smart_contract'
  - `tokenGraduated`: boolean
  - `blockDatabaseTrading`: boolean (default true)

- **Behavior**:
  - If `creation_mode === 'smart_contract'` OR `token_graduated === true`
  - AND `blockDatabaseTrading === true`
  - → Shows blue alert: "Smart Contract Token - Database simulation is disabled"
  - → Blocks children from rendering

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Navigate to a smart contract agent's page
  2. Should see blue alert about smart contract mode
  3. Database trading UI should be hidden/blocked

---

### 4. **Trade Execution Backend** ✅
- **File**: `supabase/functions/execute-bonding-curve-trade-v4/index.ts`
- **Changes**:

  **a) Agent Query Enhancement** (Line 116)
  ```typescript
  .select('*, created_prompt_usd_rate, created_p0, created_p1, graduation_mode, target_market_cap_usd, creation_mode, token_address')
  ```
  - Now fetches `creation_mode` and `token_address`

  **b) Smart Contract Mode Guard** (Lines 163-176)
  ```typescript
  if (creationMode === 'smart_contract' && !agent.token_address) {
    return 400 error: "Smart contract not deployed yet"
  }
  ```
  - Blocks database trading if agent is smart_contract mode but has no deployed contract

  **c) DEX Routing Logic** (Line 180)
  ```typescript
  const hasGraduated = 
    currentPromptRaised >= graduationThreshold || 
    agent.token_graduated || 
    (creationMode === 'smart_contract' && agent.token_address);
  ```
  - Routes to DEX if:
    - Raised enough funds to graduate, OR
    - Token already graduated, OR
    - **NEW**: Creation mode is smart_contract AND token is deployed

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Create a smart contract agent (no deployed contract yet)
  2. Try to trade on it
  3. Should get error: "Smart contract not deployed yet"
  4. Deploy the contract (add `token_address` to agent)
  5. Try to trade again
  6. Should route to DEX (check console logs for "routing to DEX trade")

---

### 5. **Admin Panel Logging** ✅
- **File**: `src/pages/Admin.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `useEffect` to log `settings.deployment_mode` on change
- **Verification**:
  1. Open browser console
  2. Toggle deployment mode in admin panel
  3. Should see: `"Current deployment mode: smart_contract"`

---

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Mode Verification
- [ ] Admin panel shows "Smart Contract" mode selected
- [ ] Console logs show: `"Current deployment mode: smart_contract"`
- [ ] Database query confirms: `deployment_mode = 'smart_contract'`

### ✅ Agent Creation
- [ ] Create new agent in smart_contract mode
- [ ] Agent created with `creation_mode = 'smart_contract'`
- [ ] Agent created with `status = 'DEPLOYING_CONTRACT'`
- [ ] Agent created with `token_graduated = true`

### ✅ Trading Guards - Before Deployment
- [ ] Navigate to smart contract agent (no token_address yet)
- [ ] See blue "Smart Contract Token" alert
- [ ] Database trading UI is blocked
- [ ] Attempt trade via API → receives 400 error

### ✅ Trading Guards - After Deployment
- [ ] Deploy contract (agent has `token_address`)
- [ ] Attempt trade → routes to DEX function
- [ ] Console shows: "routing to DEX trade"
- [ ] Trade executes on-chain (not in database)

### ✅ Database Mode Still Works
- [ ] Switch admin panel to "Database" mode
- [ ] Create new agent
- [ ] Agent created with `creation_mode = 'database'`
- [ ] Can trade using database simulation
- [ ] Trades recorded in `agent_token_buy_trades` / `agent_token_sell_trades`

---

## Key Database Tables to Check

### `admin_settings`
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_settings WHERE key = 'deployment_mode';
```

### `agents`
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  creation_mode, 
  deployment_mode, 
  status, 
  token_graduated, 
  token_address,
  created_at
FROM agents 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### `deployed_contracts`
```sql
SELECT 
  agent_id, 
  contract_address, 
  contract_type, 
  network, 
  deployment_timestamp
FROM deployed_contracts 
ORDER BY deployment_timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Scenario | creation_mode | token_address | Expected Behavior |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Smart contract agent (not deployed) | 'smart_contract' | null | ❌ Block all trading, show deployment pending message |
| Smart contract agent (deployed) | 'smart_contract' | '0x...' | ✅ Route to DEX, use on-chain trading |
| Database agent | 'database' | null | ✅ Allow database trading simulation |
| Graduated agent | 'database' | '0x...' | ✅ Route to DEX (graduated to real contract) |

---

## Console Logs to Watch

When trading on a smart contract agent, you should see:
```
🔍 Agent <name> creation_mode: smart_contract, has token_address: true
🔄 Agent <name> has graduated (...) - routing to DEX trade
```

When blocked:
```
🔍 Agent <name> creation_mode: smart_contract, has token_address: false
🚫 [Returns 400 error with message about deployment]
```

---

## Rollback Plan (if issues found)

If something breaks, revert these changes:
1. Set `deployment_mode` back to `'database'` in admin_settings
2. Git revert commits for:
   - `src/pages/CreateAgent.tsx`
   - `src/components/SmartContractModeGuard.tsx`
   - `supabase/functions/execute-bonding-curve-trade-v4/index.ts`
   - `src/pages/Admin.tsx`

---

## Status: ✅ READY FOR VERIFICATION

All changes implemented. Please run through the testing checklist above to verify the smart contract mode is working as expected.
